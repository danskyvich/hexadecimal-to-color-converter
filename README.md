# Hexadecimal Color Converter
## 💻About the website
Converts hexadecimal inputs into their colour equivalent and displays colour details on the side. A quick, small project of mine that utilises HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ❓How does it work?
After the user has input a valid hexadecimal input in the textbox, the input will be retrieved and divided into three, while removing the '#' symbol at the beginning. Using JavaScript's built-in `substring()` method, the red, green, and blue values will be extracted and then parsed using the `parseInt()` method. The outputs of both the hexadecimal and the decimal form of the input will be shown within the table on the right side of the form, including the RGB format on the bottom row of the table on the right side.
