# Hexadecimal Color Converter
## About the website
Converts hexadecimal inputs into their colour equivalent and displays colour details on the side. A quick, small project of mine during my free time. 

## How does it work?
After the user had inputted a valid hexadecimal input in the textbox, the input will be retrieved and divided into three, while removing the '#' symbol at the beginning. Using JavaScript's built-in `substring()` method, the red, green, and blue values will be extracted and then parsed using the `parseInt()` method. The outputs of both the hexadecimal and the decimal form of the input will be shown within the table on the right side of the form, including the rgb format on the last row and cell of the table.

## How to use?
1. Download all the files. It is important to have all the files on the same folder or level.
2. Open `index.html` on your preferred web browser.
3. Enjoy!
